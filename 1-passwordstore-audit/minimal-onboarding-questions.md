# About the project / Documentation

*Summary of the project. The more documentation, the better.*

# Stats

*Use something like solidity metrics or cloc to get these.*

- nSLOC: XX
- Complexity Score: XX
- Security Review Timeline: Date -> Date

These are important metrics because most of the time a security reasearch will charge base on how long he thinks a code base is going to take to audit.

There are other payments scheme such as pay per vulnerability, bug hunt, or a competitive audit.

# Setup

## Requirements

*We need to understand how to setup the project. What tools are needed to setup the codebase & test suite?*

Example:
```bash
forge init
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
forge install vectorized/solady --no-commit
forge build
```

## Testing

*How to run tests. How to see test coverage.*

Example:
```bash
forge test
```

# Security Review Scope

*The specific details of the security review. Nail down exactly what the protocol is planning on deploying, and how they plan on deploying it.*

## Commit Hash
It is important to know what is the exact commit hash that we are going to be working with here for this code base since projects are constantly fixing and changing their code bases and we don't want to spend some time on something that they've already fixed or that they're going to fix, so we want to know the exact commit hash that they are going to be deploying on chain. We want to nail down exactly what the protocol is planning on deploying and how.
## Repo URL
## In scope vs out of scope contracts
## Compatibilities

- Solc Version: XXX
- Chain(s) to deploy contract to: 
  - XXX (ie: ETH)
  - XXX (ie: Arbitrum)
- Tokens:
  - XXX (ie: ERC20s)
    - XXX (ie: LINK: <address>)
    - XXX (ie: USDC: <address>)
  - XXX (ie: ERC721s)
    - XXX (ie: CryptoKitties: <address>)
  - *List expected ERC20s and other specific tokens. If a protocol is expected to work with multiple or any tokens of a certain standard, you could do something like "All ERC20s". Or an ordered list like "USDC: <USDC Address>" etc*

# Roles

*What are the different actors of the system? What are their powers? What should/shouldn't they do?*

Example:
â€‹
```
Actors:
    Buyer: The purchaser of services, in this scenario, a project purchasing an audit.
    Seller: The seller of services, in this scenario, an auditor willing to audit a project.
    Arbiter: An impartial, trusted actor who can resolve disputes between the Buyer and Seller.
    The Arbiter is only compensated the arbiterFee amount if a dispute occurs.
```

# Known Issues

*List any issues that the protocol team is aware of and will not be acknowledging/fixing.*
